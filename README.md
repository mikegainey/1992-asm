# 1992-asm
Assembly language stuff I did in 1992 (the year I graduated with my music education degree).

This is a historical record of most the assembly language programming that I've done.

This isn't all of it, though.  My first experience with assembly language was with programming my TRS-80 Color Computer in mid 1980's.  I remember writing a program that did a buble sort on the screen buffer memory.  It would cause whatever characters were on the screen to shuffle around until they were sorted.  It would take about 5 seconds to sort a screen of 32 characters wide by 16 lines high by 1 byte per character; 512 bytes in all.  I think I was in high school at the time.  I taught myself with a book, "6809 Assembly Language Programming" or something like that.  The only languages I knew at the time were BASIC and assembly language (because I think those were the only two languages that were available for that computer at the time).

The programs in this repository are for the 80x86 processor.  I was using an IBM PC clone with an 80286 or 80386 processor.  I taught myself with the book "IBM Microcomputer Assembly Language" which is still on a shelf at my parents' house.  I probably started with 80x86 assembly language when I was in high school, but the programs in this repository are from the months after I graduated with a Bachelor of Music Education degree from Houston Baptist University in early 1992.

I got a job as a band director in 1993, joined the U.S. Army in 1996 (and retired 20 years later) and now I only have vague notions of what this code does.  I'm amazed at how organized I was with the header comments and with comments throughout the code.  I guess you have to be organized with assembly language or you won't get very far before you get lost.
